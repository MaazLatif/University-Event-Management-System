# Introduction

For BSE OOSE Course we are developing this project to automate the envents happening in universities.

Object-oriented software is a programming paradigm that has gained significant popularity and is widely used in the development of modern applications. It provides a structured approach to designing and organizing code by representing real-world entities as objects with their own data and behaviors. This methodology focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling developers to build robust, modular, and reusable software systems.

Why Study Object-Oriented Software:

Studying object-oriented software is essential for both aspiring and experienced programmers for several reasons:

Modularity and Reusability: Object-oriented programming allows developers to break down complex systems into smaller, self-contained modules (objects), making it easier to manage and maintain code. These modules can be reused in different parts of the program or in other projects, saving time and effort.
